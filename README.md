# Building standalone CyberArk Conjur Enterprise and K8s LAB
This project will help you to quickly build up the standalone, single VM lab environment to test conjur and k8s application integration including:
- conjur follower in kubernetes 
- k8s jwt authentication
- conjur push to k8s file
- conjur push to kubernetes secret
- and other

All setup, installing and configuration steps are all put in sequence of scripts to make the setup process quicker and easier

Comments and question, please send to <huy.do@cyberark.com>

Thanks and kudos to @Joe Tan (joe.tan@cyberark.com) for the detail of installing and configuration guide at https://github.com/joetanx
